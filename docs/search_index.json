It consists of 5 parts: The general trend of number of proposals, number of personnel departments related to the proposals and number of primary responsible departments; The number of proposals variation in the perspective of personnel home schools over years; The number of proposals variation in the perspective of personnel departments over years; The number of proposals variation in the perspective of primary responsible departments over years; Analysis on the properties of proposals. "],["general-trend.html", "Chapter 2 General Trend", " Chapter 2 General Trend Personnel Home Department and Primary Responsible Department In order to have a general look at the personnel home departments and primary responsible departments, I used an interactive nodes network to show all related departments and there connections. In the plot, the blue nodes show the primary responsible departments and the pink nodes show the personnel home departments. When the pink node is connected with the blue node, it means the pink node department had participated in one or more proposals that has been in charged of by the blue node department. Note: Only the first several letters of the department name is shown on the node, if you move your mouse on the nodes, you will see the full names. Organization Graph Diagram body { margin: 0; overflow: hidden; font-family: sans-serif; } As we can see from the plot, DSI has participated in many proposals that are related to various departments at Columbia University. However, this interactive network only shows all the departments that appeared after 2013. To see the variations of number of proposals, personnel home department and primary responsible departments over years, I selected bar charts to illustrate the variations. As can be seen from the bar charts above, the number of proposals improved rapidly before 2017 and came to a peak in year 2017. After 2017, the number of proposals remained at a high level. Similarly to the number of proposals, the number of participating home departments is also in an increasing trend. However, the increase is relatively slow. Different from proposals and home departments, the number of primary responsible departments doesn’t have an obvious upward trend via years. Instead, the number reaches the bottom in 2018. "],["personnel-home-schools.html", "Chapter 3 Personnel Home Schools 3.1 Sum of Proposals 3.2 Variation of Proposals 3.3 Proposals per Year", " Chapter 3 Personnel Home Schools In the provided data, there has been 85 different home departments and they belong to 35 different home school (suppose the first three letters show the school names). In this chapter, the number of proposals is analyzed from the aspect of personnel home schools. 3.1 Sum of Proposals One inportant aspect of analyzing the proposals is the total number of proposals. A cleveland dot plot is drawn to show the sum of proposals over year for different schools. As can be seen from the above cleveland dot plot, the majority of proposals are participated by DSI, ENG and A&amp;S department. This part encounters the majority of proposals. The primary responsible departments belong to two schools, ENG and DSI. Therefore, I separated the number of proposals according to the primary responsible departments to see if there are some hidden rules. Due to the large difference in quantity, I used log scale in the following cleveland dot plot. As can be seen from the above cleveland dot plot, regardless of the personnel departments, the majority of the proposals are in charge of by the ENG department category. However, when having a closer look at the specific names of the primary responsible department names, I discovered that there are some overlapping of the naming of departments. For example, we have ENG Data Science Research under ENG department, but not DSI department. 3.2 Variation of Proposals It’s also important to learn the variation of number of proposals of different personnel home departments over years. I used the range (maximum - minimum) of number of proposals to illustrate this variation. As can be seen from the above plot, the personnel home departments with top three variation in proposal numbers over years are A&amp;S, DSI and ENG. This is to some extent consistent with the total number of proposals, while the order of the top three departments are different. 3.3 Proposals per Year To see the specific variation over years, I used d3 to illustrate an interactive bar chart of the variation of number of proposals with the five departments that varies most over years. Note: In the interactive bar chart, you can click on the year to see the specific number of proposal of the selected year. If the number is greater than the previous selection, the color will be dark. If the number is smaller, the color will be light. home dept top 5 From the above interactive chart, the following trend shows up: In year 2015, the number of proposals in DSI had a sudden growth and DSI ranked from the second to the first; In year 2018, the number of proposals in A&amp;S had a sudden growth and it ranked from the third to the second; In year 2020, there was a huge shrink in the number of proposals, maybe due to COVID-19. "],["personnel-home-departments.html", "Chapter 4 Personnel Home Departments 4.1 Sum of Proposals 4.2 Range of Proposals 4.3 Proposals per Year", " Chapter 4 Personnel Home Departments In this chapter, I will dive deeper into the Personnel Home Departments to see their relations with proposals. 4.1 Sum of Proposals As can be seen from the cleveland dot plot of sum proposals of home schools, the majority of proposals are participated by DSI, ENG and A&amp;S department. To see which departments contributes most to the number of proposals, I used another cleveland dot plot with the detailed information of departments of DSI, ENG and A&amp;S. From the above plot, it is that DSI school has only one department, which is DSI General. In ENG department, ENG Computer Science and ENG Electrical Engineering contributes most to number of proposals. In A&amp;S department, A&amp;S Columbia Astropysics Lab, and A&amp;S Statistics contributes most to the number of proposals. 4.2 Range of Proposals For the schools with large variations of number of proposals, we need to know which departments contributes most to the variations. Therefore, a more detailed cleveland dot plot is drawn. The top two departments that contribute most to the variation in ENG are ENG Electrical Engineering and ENG Computer Science. The top two in A&amp;S are A&amp;S Columbia Astropysics Lab, and A&amp;S Statistics. It’s clear that the variations have a very strong positive connection with the number of proposals. Therefore, I used another cleveland dot plot to show the normalized variance, which is equal to the range of proposals over years divided by the sum of proposals in that school. As can be seen from the plot, in ENG department, ENG IEOR General and ENG CVN have the highest percentage of variance. In A&amp;S, A&amp;P Political Science, A&amp;S Mathematics, A&amp;S English &amp; Comparative Lit, A&amp;S Economics, A&amp;S Earth &amp; Environ Sci, A&amp;S E3B and A&amp;S Centers have the highest percentage of variance, and the percentages all reaches 100%. Surprisingly, ENG Computer Science, ENG Electrical Engineering, DSI General, A&amp;S Columbia Astrophysics Lab and A&amp;S Statistics, which have very large number of variation in proposals, get relatively low variance in percentage. This may be because the sub-departments with very small number of proposals may vary from 0 proposal in some year to more than one proposals in some other year, then the percentage of variance will be 100%. Comparatively, the sub-departments with large number of proposals are stable in some degree. 4.3 Proposals per Year To see the specific variation over years, I used d3 to show an interactive bar chart of the variation of number of proposals with the five departments that varies most over years. home dept top 5 From the above interactive chart, the following trend shows up: The overall trend of proposals in home departments is increasing, while in 2020, there was a sudden decrease, maybe due to COVID-19; DSI General had huge increases in 2015 and 2017 and it rank first in every year; A&amp;S Astrophysics Lab had a sudden increase in 2018, and a sudden decrease in 2020. "],["primary-responsible-departments.html", "Chapter 5 Primary Responsible Departments", " Chapter 5 Primary Responsible Departments Another angle to analyze on these proposals is from the perspective of primary responsible departments. I also use d3 to show the interactive bar chart. home dept top 5 From the above charts, the following trend shows up: Proposal number of ENG DATA SCIENCE Research had a sudden increase in 2015 and continued increasing until 2019, after 2019, it dropped gradually; After 2014, ENG DATA SCIENCE Research was responsible for far more proposals than other departments; ENG CCLS Research once took in charge of many proposals, but after 2018, it almost doesn’t take charge of proposals; Before 2018, DSI Research General didn’t take charge of proposals, while after 2018, it increased the number and maintained at that level. 2018 is also the time point when ENG DATA SCIENCE Research and ENG CCLS Research started to decrease. "],["properties-of-proposals.html", "Chapter 6 Properties of Proposals", " Chapter 6 Properties of Proposals Among all the proposals, some proposals only existed for one year, while others existed for more than one year. To see the categories of how long the proposals have existed, I selected the bar chart. As can be seen above, the majority of the proposals are one-year proposals. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion DSI has grown rapidly over the past years and has participated in many interdisciplinary proposals. Although there are some tiny changes over years, the general increasing trend is very stable. However, most proposals are participated by several specific departments, like EE, CS, STATS, etc. For some other departments, like psychology, although they have participated, but the frequency is much lower. Maybe in the future, DSI can try to explore more on these subjects. "]]
