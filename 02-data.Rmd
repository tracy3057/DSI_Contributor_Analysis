## Employment by Years

In order to have an idea of the changes of number of employed in different occupations by years, we use an interactive bar chart to show the trends more clearly. When you click on a year, the button will turn palevioletred and the bar chart will provide you with the employment data of that year. The palevioletred colored bars mean the number of employed in this specific occupation is larger than the one of your previous click. Instead, the pink bars represent the number of employed decrease.\
